What Git Stash Does and When It Is Useful?

Git Stash is useful when you are working on a feature or a task and realize that you need to switch to another branch (e.g., to fix a bug or pull in updates). You might have uncommitted changes that you donâ€™t want to lose but are not ready to commit.
Stashing allows you to save these uncommitted changes temporarily, clean up your working directory, and switch branches without committing your work.
